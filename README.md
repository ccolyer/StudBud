Limitations:
My initial XD mocked design proved to be much more complex than anticipated, with my specifications list potentially also lacking in 
research/detail to direct the build of each component. Additionally, time constraints restricted the depth/level of creativity I could achieve with
the styling of each of the designs. Due to these limitations, the app did not perfectly resemble my mockup, nor tick off every box on my technical specs
list, however it still exhibits some of the main functionalities required from the brief.
